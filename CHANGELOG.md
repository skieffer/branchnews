## [v0.2.0](https://github.com/skieffer/branchnews/tree/v0.2.0) - 2024-05-28


### Improvements

- Improved the dialog in the `branchnews create` command:

  * Lists news categories by their full titles
  * Tells you the directory in which the news file can be found
  * Gives hints about the format of the release note
